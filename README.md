# Inferential-Statistics-Exercises
Three data sets(human body temperature, resume call backs, and hospital readmissions) were examined as part of the Springboard Data Science Intensive program.

Exercise 1 is a study of Human Body Temperature
Data set was created by Allen Shoemaker of Calvin College in 1996 to be used for educational purposes.  It is comprised of 130 observations, half male and half female, of body temperature and heart rate.  More information can be found here: https://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/v4n2/datasets.shoemaker.html
Summary of Data Analysis:
  Data was checked for normality using several methods: visual inspection of distribution plot, D-Agostino and Pearson's statistical test,   and a linear regression.
  Data was checked for correlation between body temperature and heart rate.
  A one sample t-test was performed to compare the mean of the data sample to the "known" mean of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit.
  A determination was made of what the range of "normal" temperature should be considered based on the data set.
  The mean temperatures of males and females was compared and found to be different.
  The t-test for two independent samples was calculated to determine if the difference in means is due to chance or is "real".
  Finally, it was determined whether or not the difference in means is statistically significant.
A summary of the findings, conclusions, and recommendations are at the end of the notebook.
