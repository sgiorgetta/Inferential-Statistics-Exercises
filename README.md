# Inferential-Statistics-Exercises
Three data sets(human body temperature, resume call backs, and hospital readmissions) were examined as part of the Springboard Data Science Intensive program.

Exercise 1 is a study of Human Body Temperature.  Filename: sliderule_dsi_inferential_statistics_exercise_1.

Data set was created by Allen Shoemaker of Calvin College in 1996 to be used for educational purposes.  It is comprised of 130 observations, half male and half female, of body temperature and heart rate.  More information can be found here: https://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/v4n2/datasets.shoemaker.html
Summary of Data Analysis:
  Data was checked for normality using several methods: visual inspection of distribution plot, D-Agostino and Pearson's statistical test,   and a linear regression.
  Data was checked for correlation between body temperature and heart rate.
  A one sample t-test was performed to compare the mean of the data sample to the "known" mean of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit.
  A determination was made of what the range of "normal" temperature should be considered based on the data set.
  The mean temperatures of males and females was compared and found to be different.
  The t-test for two independent samples was calculated to determine if the difference in means is due to chance or is "real".
  Finally, it was determined whether or not the difference in means is statistically significant.
A summary of the findings, conclusions, and recommendations are at the end of the notebook.

Exercise 2 is a study of racial discrimination. Filename: sliderule_dsi_inferential_statistics_exercise_2
The Data was taken from a field study that occured between 2000 and 2002. Approximately 5000 resumes were submitted in response to 1300 job advertisements.  Each employer received 4 resumes: two were high quality resumes and two were low quality resumes.  "Black" sounding names and "white" sounding names were randomly assigned to the resumes. Email responses and callbacks were recorded.
Summary of Data Analysis:
  Proportion hypothesis testing was done on the difference in email response and callbacks based on race. The testing was repeated for about eight other measures such as volunteer work, special skills, computer skills, honors awards, gender, military service, employment holes, and quality of the resume.
  Additional analysis was done to investigate the influence of level of education, number of previous jobs held, years of experience, and the zipcode of the applicant.  The zipcode reflected the percentage of "blacks" that resided in the neighborhood of the applicant and it was plotted against percentage of callbacks to check for a correlation.
  The results are summarized at the end of the notebook.
